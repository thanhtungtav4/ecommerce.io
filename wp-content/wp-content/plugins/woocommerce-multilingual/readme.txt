== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this work with other e-commerce plugins? =

No. This plugin is tailored for WooCommerce.

= What do I need to do in my theme? =

Make sure that your theme is not hard-coding any URL. Always use API calls to receive URLs to pages and you'll be fine.

= Why does my checkout page display in the same language? =

Some themes and plugins provide their own translations via localization files. To apply these translations, you need to scan the theme or plugin providing these files. Go to **WPML &rarr; Theme and Plugins Localization**, select the theme or plugin providing the checkout page, and scan it.

You can also translate the checkout page yourself by going to **WPML &rarr; String Translation**.

Read more about [translating cart and checkout pages](https://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/translating-cart-and-checkout-pages/).

= Can I have different URLs for the store in different languages? =

Yes. You can translate the product permalink base, product category base, product tag base and the product attribute base on the Store URLs section.

= Why do my product category pages return a 404 error? =

In this case, you may need to translate the product category base. You can do that on the Store URLs section.

= Can I set the prices in the secondary currencies? =

By default, the prices in the secondary currencies are determined using the exchange rates that you fill in when you add or edit a currency. On individual products, however, you can override this and set prices manually for the secondary currencies.

= Can I have separate currencies for each language? =

Yes. By default, each currency will be available for all languages, but you can customize this and disable certain currencies on certain languages. You also have the option to display different currencies based on your customers’ locations instead.

= Is this plugin compatible with other WooCommerce extensions? =

WooCommerce Multilingual is compatible with all major WooCommerce extensions. We’re continuously working on checking and maintaining compatibility and collaborate closely with the authors of these extensions.

== Installation ==
= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.7 or later
* PHP version 5.6 or later
* MySQL version 5.6 or later
* WooCommerce 3.9.0 or later
